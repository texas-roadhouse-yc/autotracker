## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the **Aalborg Traffic Sign (ATS)** dataset.

Directory structure:

```
project-root/
└── data/
    ├── sampled_dataset.csv
    ├── updated_sampled_dataset.csv
    └── deleted_sampled_dataset.csv
```

👉 **The following are descriptions of the datasets:**

- **ATS with GPS Noise (ATS-loc):**  
  A synthetic dataset created by injecting GPS noise into ATS, resulting in trajectories that approximate the original historical paths.

- **ATS with Heading Noise (ATS-dir):**  
  A synthetic dataset generated by adding noise to the heading (direction) component of ATS, producing motion directions aligned with historical data.

- **ATS with Time Noise (ATS-time):**  
  A synthetic dataset created by introducing noise into the timestamps of ATS trajectories, enabling the study of effects such as lighting variations related to time.

> ⚠️ Due to file size limitations on GitHub, only a portion of the dataset is included in this repository.  
> The **complete dataset** is available via OneDrive: [https://1drv.ms/f/c/3f7c18cfa605badd/EktZctPAN9BAky1lzTy6RVYBz4MQTOnwCUpW5BQaACr69w?e=ydEIjv]
